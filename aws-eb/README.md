# GitHub Actions for AWS Elastic Beanstalk

This Action for [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) enables arbitrary actions for interacting with AWS Elastic Beanstalk service via [the `eb` command-line client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3.html). It's based on the [GitHub Actions for AWS](https://github.com/actions/aws).

## Usage

The example below illustrates how to deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk and report status back to [GitHub Deployment API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/deployments/), so that [SlashDeploy](https://getslashdeploy.com/) could process the deployment and notify Slack.

```
workflow "Deploy to AWS EB" {
  on = "deployment"
  resolves = ["deploy"]
}

action "deploy.scripts" {
  uses = "unacast/actions/github-deploy@master"
}

action "deploy" {
  uses = "getslashdeploy/actions/aws-eb@master"
  secrets = ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
  args = "deploy <ENTER NAME OF EB ENVIRONMENT>"
  needs = ["deploy.scripts"]
}
```
